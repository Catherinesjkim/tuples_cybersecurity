# 🛡️ Tuples in Python for Cybersecurity

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of tuples in Python, especially focusing on how immutability can be helpful in cybersecurity contexts like maintaining unalterable access control lists (ACLs) or trusted software identifiers.

## 📚 Notebook Included

- **tuples_practice.ipynb**  
  A step-by-step tutorial on creating and using tuples, practicing:
  - Defining tuples with different data types.
  - Accessing tuple elements by index.
  - Demonstrating immutability (attempting to modify a tuple).
  - Using tuples to store trusted software IDs for security.
  - Basic tuple operations like `len()` and `index()`.

## ✅ What you’ll learn

✔️ How to create tuples of different data types  
✔️ How to access tuple elements  
✔️ Why tuples are immutable, and why that’s useful for security  
✔️ How to safely check membership in a tuple  
✔️ How to use tuples to store fixed lists of trusted or blocked items

## 📦 How to use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
